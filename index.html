    <div class="poem">
      <p class="kyle">A half-eaten moon <br>is still a warmed celestial speck<br>amongst marred and violet clouds.</p>
      <p class="kyle"><br>Despite its distance,<br>its visibility reminds my tongue<br>of the half-eaten cake in the kitchen.</p>
      <p class="kyle"><br>I’ll return to it when I can,<br>but first I have a job,<br>a role to play.</p>
      <p class="kyle"><br>I’m outside Jenny’s truck,<br>looking for a container<br>I have to empty.</p>
      <p class="kyle"><br>In the backseat<br>under some blankets,<br>I see the glinting blue jug.</p>
      <p class="kyle"><br>Upon tugging it towards me,<br>my forearms feel its weight,<br>more cumbersome than expected.</p>
      <p class="kyle"><br>Moving around the garden,<br>pretending it to be gasoline,<br>I, the rebellious, live in a scorched land.</p>
      <p class="kyle"><br>I laugh at the fragility of the orchids,<br>dousing their stems and inundating them <br>until their small soft hairs are severed and submerged.</p>
      <p class="kyle"><br>I mock the thin-skinned marrows, <br>swerving and stomping through <br>overgrown, overprotective leaves.</p>
      <p class="kyle"><br>I strike a match against naked air<br>and flick its flames into the field<br>just before coming back in, still hungry.</p>

<h2 style="color:#839073;"> tower 32</h2>

 <button type="button" class="collapsible"><img class="arrow" src="arrow.gif"></img></button>
	<div class="content">
		<p>Darryl slid three quarters into the vending machine and weighed his options. The machine valued the antiques at 500 ₵. It gave him the options of directly transferring to his bank account, directly paying his debts, or gaining credit with three of the largest food dispensaries. The number, which had originally made his heart leap, now depressed him when he looked at his debts. 500 ₵ would have allowed him to buy almost three weeks’ worth of decent food, but only covered half of this month’s interest.</p>
		<p>The machine flashed a time out warning,</p>
		<p>PLEASE MAKE SELECTION OR RECLAIM THREE (3) ITEMS</p>
		<p>30 SECONDS REMAINING</p>
		<p>He hurriedly transferred the money to his debt and immediately regretted it. The machine went dark briefly, then began to cycle through a stream of catchy phrases, asking for anything from recyclables to old books. He tried to imagine what was behind the machine: a giant shelving unit filled with oddities.</p>
		<p><i>Do you have time to get dinner?</i> He sent the <b>Thought</b> directly to Emily’s cognitive implants.</p>
		<p>At first, he received no response. He checked the empty street for vehicles, then crossed to the walk by the railing and looked out. The buildings around him stretched up and down, the shiny metal reflecting the neon lights. Level number, names of various businesses, and directions to different districts distorted across windows, lighting the entire area even though the sky above held little light.</p>
		<p>Emily lived across that unnerving divide. Above her house was a restaurant called:</p>
		<p style="text-indent: 0px;text-align: center;"><b>LEVEL 14 PHO 72</b></p>
		<p>The place seemed familiar, and Darryl always wanted to go there, but Emily hated the place. They always ate where Emily preferred because Darryl was restricted to Class 2 rations. His income was pre-divided neatly between his debts, his rent, and his living expenses. If he bought a Class 4 meal, he wouldn’t be able to eat for 3 days.</p>
		<p><i>I could eat. I’ll meet you at the crossroad.</i></p>
		<p>Darryl took the elevator down to the 12th floor, where the two spines were joined by a small walkway. He crossed over to spine R3-4 and waited. He met Emily on the first day of his job, cleaning under her desk. Like all industrious archetypes, Emily was welcoming, keen, kind, and energetic.</p>
		<p>She stepped off her own elevator and waved to him exuberantly, “Hey, how was work? I finished earlier, but then I thought of something, so I decided to remote in for a little while. I was thinking of checking out this place on the rim, like R-20, or something.”</p>
		<p>“You didn’t fulfill today’s fitness requirements, did you?”</p>
		<p>System’s managers, like Emily, spent most of their day sitting, and thus had a required exercise quota to fulfill after hours. These were met on a weekly basis, making the streets crowded every Friday. Today was Tuesday, but Emily liked to keep on top of her requirements. In contrast, Darryl was a janitor and spent a large amount of time on his feet, going up and down stairs. His main requirements were nice shoes and monthly physicals to make sure he was following ergonomic cleaning strategies. Failure to comply resulted in reductions in meal class, downgrades in living quarters, or less pay.</p>
		<p>“There’s SO much to do at work. They’re thinking of bringing one of the dead towers back online. Of course, that means we need to assess how many people we can spare. If we make a few major policy decisions, we could increase our population donation by 15%. That’s pretty substantial. Anything that helps get more towers running is good.”</p>
		<p>“You think you could make it so I got shipped out?”</p>
		<p>She shook her head, “No, of course not. I would do a-n-y-t-h-i-n-g to keep you here. I need a friend, don’t I?”</p>
		<p>He rolled his eyes, “I know you already have plenty of friends at work. But you’re right, if I got transferred to a new tower, my work hours would increase, something I’m not keen on.”</p>
		<p>“And what do you do with your free time? Stare over the railing?”</p>
		<p>“Sometimes, I go to the AR. Read history. It’s all about the potential to do things. Speaking of which, I sold the coins today.”</p>
		<p>She checked her heart rate through her cognitive implants then pressed him to walk a little faster. “You didn’t have to do that. I don’t think you should have done it. You don’t even know what they meant to you.”</p>
		<p>“Well, I’m not going to find out by letting them sit there.”</p>
		<p>She started jogging, so he did as well. She didn’t respond, which made him feel bad. He shouldn’t pressure Emily about his memories. He suspected she knew everything: the extent of his crimes, why he had such outstanding debt, what he used to do. There was no other reason for a wealthy system’s manager to take so much interest in the life of an indebted janitor.</p>
		<p>When they finally reached R-20, he could see out past the remaining spines to the landscape beyond. The lights of the other towers shone brightly in the distance, illuminating the hulls of some empty towers yet to be activated.</p>
		<p>“Which one do you think it will be?” He pointed through the spines.</p>
		<p>She shrugged, “That’s a little above my paygrade. I assume they’ll pick one that makes the most sense from an efficiency standpoint.”</p>
		<p>The towers were all the same. They each had a center nexus surrounded by spines that decreased in height radially, and functioned as neighborhoods. Each person had their place in the neighborhood, and in the tower. As the population of the tower increased, duty shifts would overlap more, and people had more free time. When all the towers had enough surplus people, they would open another tower.</p>
		<p>“I wonder what life is like out there.” Darryl motioned at the dark space beyond the perimeter. “Is it just the bugs and weeds until someone shows up? Maybe a tree or two splitting the concrete?”</p>
		<p>“I like to think the bots keep the sites pretty well organized. From what I’ve heard, it takes a lot to bring the sites back online. They were constructed quite a while ago, when they thought more people would survive.” </p>
		<p>They ordered some hamburgers, and he dug right in. The taste was delicious after subsisting on Nutrition Pack #5 for the last two weeks. He savoured each fry, digging them into his milkshake. Emily laughed at his expressions, then morphed her face into one of curiosity, “How would you do it?”</p>
		<p>“Do what?”</p>
		<p>“Make the transition.”</p>
		<p>He thought about it. It seemed to be a simple tradeoff. Everyone worked eight-hour shifts and they overlapped by three hours with the next crew. Now people would have to work nine-hour shifts that overlapped by two hours? Ten-hour shifts. There had to be some efficiency trade-off by scheduling certain jobs, in proximity to other jobs. He shrugged, “I don’t know. Not my problem.”</p>
		<p>She took a drink of her soda to hide her disappointment. “It will be when you’re working more.”</p>
		<p>“And I would appreciate it if you didn’t make too many changes with my shifts.”</p>
		<p>They talked a bit more about their days, before they ran back to the inside of the ring. After dropping Emily off, Darryl went to the 14th floor of R3-4 and stared in the other direction. He could see the doorstep of his apartment complex, the line of vending machines he had just been standing at, and a rugged AR booth, just before the walkway curved around. He liked this view better. It felt less foreign, and he could hear the patrons coming and going from Pho 76 or one of the nearby restaurants. R2-4 was more subdued than R3-4; less glamorous tenants, he supposed.</p>
		<p>He cast a glance over at the restaurant as the door swung open. The heel of a dress shoe kept it from falling closed again as the conversation continued.</p>
		<p>“Thank you, this was a great evening, Bui. I’m going to try making it over more often. It’s just been hard.” Her voice resonated with him, and he craned his neck so he could see her face.</p>
		<p>A hand took over holding the door and the woman walked out backwards, closing the door gently behind her. She was short, around 155 cm, with a single long braid that fell down from her otherwise cropped hair. Something clenched in his chest as she turned around. He spoke before he could help himself.</p>
		<p>“Wait.”</p>
		<p>The woman froze, looked at his face, then tried to keep walking.</p>
		<p>“Do I know you?” he asked, feeling with an absolute certainty that he did.</p>
		<p>They stood there for a while, people passing by. Her face was drawn, becoming more and more stressed as she could not deny recognizing him. Finally, not without tenderness, she whispered, “Oh, Darryl, I can’t.”</p>
		<p>Then she walked away, and he was alone.<br><br></p>
		<p>It had been five months. Five months of paying back unknown debts, five months of wondering why he was so unhappy. It never got easier. He woke up sweating from dreams that had no form and spent night hours wandering streets hoping the locations would spark recollection.</p>
		<p>It was New Year’s, and he had been staring over the railing for about three hours now. Emily was gone. She had a few parties to go to. People Darryl didn’t know, and she didn’t care for him to meet. Her face was apologetic when leaving, a general refrain from their more recent interactions. Their meals together had become shorter, farther in between. </p>
		<p>He braced himself as yet another person tried to take his place at the front of the line. He shot them a quick glare, which they returned before fading back into the crowd.</p>
		<p>A few moments later, all the lights around him switched off. He gasped, like a child as the show began, starting at the base of the nearest tower, and hopping backward across the others into the night. The barrage of colors was highly coordinated, designed to look continuous from all angles. For a moment, he took his eyes off the main show, and looked back across the crowd. Faces flickered from blue to green, as their own tower put on its display. </p>
		<p>“There, there.” At once, people started pointing excitedly towards one of the darker spots in the trees. A single point of red light, trailing smoke, peaked for a moment, and then extinguished. Shortly after, a small green light shot up in another dark patch to the east. Everyone held their breath, waiting for more but eventually focused their eyes back on the main show.</p>
		<p>“Only two groups made it this year, huh,” he heard someone mutter. “Not surprised.”</p>
		<p>He instantly let go of the railing in shock and let the sea of bodies surging forward push him back into an emptier space. He resented the epiphany, because he felt as if he was ignoring the possibility on purpose. Now that it was obvious, he was driven to look up the location of the nearest history museum. With one more reluctant look at the dazzling display, he left the outer radius.</p>
		<p>The museum was almost empty when he got there. Most of the lights were dimmed to conserve power, but a spotlight appeared over his head as soon as he entered. It followed him around as he drifted past various exhibits, until he found a service node.</p>
		<p> He engaged it with his cortical implant, and it immediately began its welcoming routine.</p>
		<p><i>Hello, welcome to HCM automated service unit please select one of the…</i></p>
		<p><i>Scientific consultation.</i> He <b>Thought</b> at it.</p>
		<p><i>Our facility offers many consultation services such as: interactive holographic storytelling, thesis revision, research—</i></p>
		<p><b>Faculty scientist.</b></p>
		<p><i>Our faculty scientists are busy, perhaps—</i></p>
		<p><b>Faculty scientist.</b></p>
		<p><i>Alternatives to in-person consultations include—</i></p>
		<p><b>Faculty scientist.</b></p>
		<p>The module buzzed a little in annoyance and went dark. He tapped it a few times, then leaned against the wall. Just as he was about to give up, a slight hiss startled him, and the wall next to him slid open. He was greeted by a sour, middle-aged man, with grey temples and baggy eyes. Historians, like other scientists, were only hired if they were faultlessly devoted to restoring the Earth’s ecosystem. They were high strung, overworked, and this one was no exception. </p>
		<p>“How can I help you, Darryl Winston?” His voice dripped with disdain.</p>
		<p>“I want to inquire about some artifacts I sold to the vending machine.”</p>
		<p>“For the last time, there are no returns for surrendered items. The government does not force people to give up their heirlooms, but it is under no obligation to return them. If you are concerned about fraud, you can fill out the necessary paperwork.” He turned on his heel and reached for the button to close the door.</p>
		<p>“Actually, I would like a follow-up,” Darryl blurted, trying to sound as scholarly as possible, "I turned the artifacts in because I was interested in their history. They were given to me by a friend, he passed away before he could tell me where they came from."</p>
		<p>The scientist pursed his lips, then motioned for Darryl to follow him. He was immediately blasted with compressed air and UV light to eliminate some of the contagions, before being allowed in a small office.</p>
		<p>Darryl mentally checked the public database for the scientist’s name and found it to be Patrick Moreno y Reyes. Patrick pulled up some black and white images that looked like patches of coral growing out of ravines.</p>
		<p>“This is an electron microscopy surface image. This coin was 2025, a rather old one. You can see from the features that the coin has not been maintained, but exposed to natural decay processes. This indicates that this is a recent archeological find rather than a family heirloom.”</p>
		<p>“Are all of them like that?”</p>
		<p>“Yes, they were most likely excavated from the same site.”</p>
		<p>“Do you know where?”</p>
		<p>Patrick smiled, then quickly flattened his face, “Of course, I know where. The soil composition of the different regions causes different nanoscale decay patterns.”</p>
		<p>He pulled up a map. “Here’s the land nearby. Around where Towers 30-32 are constructed. There’s a lot of other things I could tell you, as well. For instance, we believe that the item was under the tower construct for quite some time. Though it aged due to environmental factors, it is also well-preserved. This makes me think that the soil around it was more compact and didn’t see natural water flow.”</p>
		<p>“Dr. Moreno, thank you. This information is incredible. Could you forward a copy to my files?”</p>
		<p>“Sure, your friend was most likely an Interwalker then?”</p>
		<p>“An Interwalker?” It was the possibility that Darryl had ignored, perhaps foolishly, perhaps out of denial.</p>
		<p>“Yes, most surface archaeology is done on other parts of the planet. If the coins came from nearby, your friend wouldn’t have had a permit.” The historian cleared his throat: “Well then, mystery solved. You have your answer, and I should be working. Please leave the way you came in.”<br><br></p>
		<p>Darryl turned his face upward and closed his eyes. The pale winter sun fell on the rooftop of Level 50, R-10, and dispelled the slight chill that affected the lower levels.</p>
		<p>Emily stirred her tea, “Isn’t the view marvelous? The vegetation diversity has really improved over the last thirty or so years. A lot more continuous too. Do you remember being a kid and seeing…” She broke off, “Well, I mean, you’ve seen the slides in the history museum. And the AR. The geo-engineers and biologists have really done wonders.”</p>
		<p>He nodded. “Did you see the light show?”</p>
		<p>“Yeah, they also did some great work. Can’t wait until the next tower comes online. Then we won’t have so many dark spots.”</p>
		<p>“I saw a couple of flares go up.”</p>
		<p>She bit off half a biscuit, and frowned at it, before placing it on her saucer, “I didn’t notice. The main display IS kind of the point.”</p>
		<p>“It made me think about the coins, the ones I sold. So I went to ask at the museum, and they said they were from an archeological expedition.”</p>
		<p>Emily broke apart the cookie, and pushed the crumbs into smaller and smaller crumbs. “I don’t think you should’ve sold them.”</p>
		<p>“But I had to know. I’ve been so unhappy, and I wanted to know more about who I am.”</p>
		<p>“Isn’t that the point of the traumatic reset?” Her voice was rather sharp: “The bots wouldn’t have erased your memory if YOU hadn’t given them permission.”</p>
		<p>“How can I know if I gave them permission if I can’t remember that?”</p>
		<p>“Because bots have safeguards. Humans were there too.”</p>
		<p>“I feel like I can’t be responsible for these debts if I don’t know what I did to cause them. I’m just saying that I want to go there and see for myself.”</p>
		<p>She gritted her teeth, “I just... No. You can’t. You act like you’re a victim, but literally everything that has happened to you, since the beginning, has been your responsibility.”</p>
		<p>He looked quickly around, but thankfully her raised voice hadn’t attracted much attention. “I think I need to know what I did wrong to improve myself.”</p>
		<p>“No, you won’t change. This is exactly what happened last time. The questioning, the speculation, you giving up your career for some stupid wandering in the woods.” She held up her hand to stop him from responding. “You were brilliant, you know. I’m not supposed to tell you this, but you were one of the best system’s managers I ever worked with. Until you started buying into all that idiocy: What if the bots are lying about the dismal state of the planet? What if we could build settlement sprawls like in the history novels? The rules of the towers were too constraining, so YOU destroyed YOUR marriage, your career, our friendship. And then, like the coward you are, you chose to have your memory erased so you could just start over. Now, I get to watch you leave, again? For how long?”</p>
		<p>He was staggered by the magnitude of her words, but stuttered out, “Not long; maybe a few weeks. However long it takes.”</p>
		<p>She drank the rest of her tea, and grabbed the last biscuit off the table, “Fine, but I’m not going to be here again when you come back. I’m the ONLY one who volunteered to help rehabilitate you. What does that tell you, Darryl?”</p>
		<p>He sat at the table after she left, ruminating on her outburst. His head throbbed dully. It was hard to process her friendship as a true loss. While she had been kind to him, he didn’t feel as deep a friendship between them as she obviously did. He got into the elevator and rode it to Level 1. The base of the tower was remarkably plain. The human residences, restaurants, and employment all began at Level 7, meaning the only occupants down here were a few bots delivering packages from tower to tower. They didn’t give him a glance as he walked past them to the edge of the furthest ring.</p>
		<p>In the last spine, he found an alcove, and connected to the terminal.</p>
		<p><i>Darryl Winston, do you wish to leave Tower 12?</i></p>
		<p><b>Yes.</b></p>
		<p><i>We will go through the necessary steps for you to become an interim member of society.</i></p>
		<p><i>1) Please notify your employer of your absence. You will be allowed to use your holidays. Once your holidays are used, you will be terminated. When you return, your position will not be guaranteed. In addition, after two weeks, your residence will be surrendered. If you do not notify your employer, you will have two weeks of wage debt added to your account. Do you wish to notify your employer?</i></p>
		<p><b>Yes.</b></p>
		<p><i>2) Please take some supplies. You may have food for two (2) weeks, a flare gun with six (6) colors, blue meaning “AID NEEDED”. You will have a blanket, compass, water bottle, filter, and fire starter. All supplies will be added to your wage debt. You may refill supplies at any tower. Please enter how long you will be absent.</i></p>
		<p><b>Two weeks.</b></p>
		<p><i>3) You are now being informed that all property and HIGH ecosystem damage will be added to your wage debt. This includes wild-fires, endangered species loss, etc. Please take the provided field guide on RARE and EDIBLE species. Please note that general ecosystem upkeep and pollination require bots. Do not disturb bots. While leaving the tower is not a criminal offense, disturbing bots is a criminal offense.</i></p>
		<p><b>Informed.</b></p>
		<p><i>4) You are now being informed that when you reenter society, the costs of your medical exam and quarantine will be added to your wage debt.</i></p>
		<p><b>Informed.</b></p>
		<p>The screen went dark and a panel slid open revealing a neatly packed backpack. He pulled it out, and slid it on, noting how perfectly it fit him. He gave the machine a small smile, and then walked over the edge of the concrete perimeter into the forest.</p>
		<p>He kept his footsteps light, often looking back to make sure the plants weren’t too wilted under his step. The signals probing at his cortical node became dim, and he began to feel a little lonely. In the VR rooms, forests were full of life. Gnats stuck in your teeth, birds chirped incessantly, streams with tadpoles danced around rocky beds, and the wind pushed dappled patterns around the forest floor. </p>
		<p>All he heard was the sound of his own footsteps, all he felt was the rough bark under his fingers when he needed to reach out and steady himself. He estimated he had walked three hours before he had to stop. His breath was coming in gasps, and he leaned over his hands on his knees. As his eyes focused on the group, he saw a stream of insects wandering across the leaves. He checked a nearby log, then sat down, and let one crawl along his hand.</p>
		<p>He chuckled, remembering the old trick of adding ants to elementary school ecosystem simulations to increase biodiversity. The expression ‘At least the ants survive’ was used to mean a project completed in an annoying or barely functional manner.</p>
		<p>The ant bit his finger, and he flicked it away. For a moment, his voice was the only sound in the quiet. After another four hours of struggling onward, with many breaks, he lay down on the middle of the forest floor, stretched a blanket over himself, and fell asleep.<br><br></p>
		<p>Two days later, he was incredibly sweaty, tired, and sore. The inside of his mouth was constantly dry, but he’d only found one stream to fill his water bottle at. He’d followed it as long as he could, but it had inevitably split from his trajectory. His clothes were already sporting rips in the knees from falling.</p>
		<p>He took out his compass again to reaffirm his trajectory, then blinked. He saw light reflecting through the trees, and quickened his step. The forest opened up abruptly, roots ending in tall grass that fell away a meter later to hard concrete.</p>
		<p>There the similarities between his tower and this one ended. Immediately beyond the border were several raised sheets of metal, supported by piping. The edge of the concrete was broken through in several places and the dirt dug away to form troughs.</p>
		<p>He approached the nearest crude structure, and found it much larger than he originally thought. The entrance was obscured by a worn cloth draped and rotted at the bottom. A layer of woven branches lay under the cloth. He pulled them aside, wincing at how easily they tore and cracked. Inside were four beds and a table, scattered open boxes that functioned as storage units. One box was full of clothes, another piled with booklets. He picked one up.</p>
		<p><i>Sturdy Fence Making Part 2.</i></p>
		<p>He flipped through the pages, where drawings, childish but informative, laid out how to assemble split wood using long strands of wiring. He picked up the other titles: <i>Irrigation Part 1, Cow Slaughtering Part 2, Shelter Construction Part 5</i>.</p>
		<p>He heard the sticks behind him crackle and turned his head too quickly. He hit a low-hanging piece of iron, and staggered back, tripping over a box. A rather large utility bot struggled against the branches, its foreleg caught between two sticks.</p>
		<p>“Ah, it is just you, Darryl Winston. Nice to see you again.”</p>
		<p>The mental query Darryl sent to it failed. The bot flashed a few lights to indicate its amusement.</p>
		<p>“You don’t have a high enough clearance level to access my specs, I’m afraid.”</p>
		<p>Darryl helped the bot untangle their appendages and they walked out of the shelter. “What happened here?”</p>
		<p>“A rather successful colony. It lasted 32 years, longer than most.”</p>
		<p>They continued, side by side, looking through the metal shelters, coming to a region where the concrete had been utterly destroyed and removed. Almost one-third of the circle had been excavated and overgrown. He knelt by the side of one of the fields and found the husks of seed pods still lay on the ground.</p>
		<p>He turned around, focusing on the spines of the tower. The sheathing was missing at the bottom and a lot of the wiring was torn out, presumably used to bind the fence posts.</p>
		<p>“This place is beautiful.”</p>
		<p>The chaos of the disturbed metal, the stumps of spit trees, and the remains of rotted fruit at the bottom of a tiny orchard brought tears to his eyes. </p>
		<p>The droid laid his foreleg on Darryl’s shoulder, “Yes, it is quite nice. I’m sorry it couldn’t last.”</p>
		<p>“Why did they leave?”</p>
		<p>“The same reason that all of these colonies have failed over the years. Disease, then famine, primarily. Biologists stole the crops and animal prototypes from the lab. They are all raised in highly protected environments. When your food supply is dependent on only a few crops with poor immune systems, it is destined to fail. Though they lasted longer than most.”</p>
		<p>“And I lived here.”</p>
		<p>“For seven years. I’m glad to see you again. You are not the first to come back. A few of your fellow colonists have also figured out their origin. I enjoy providing them with closure that the trauma reset could not.”</p>
		<p>“How many people died?”</p>
		<p>“Fifteen. It was hard, as many were young. It was especially hard for you. As a system’s manager, you recruited quite a few people in your seven years. You were a good leader. It was clear to us you could not live with that guilt, especially when your wife refused to speak with you. So eventually, we offered a trauma reset. Unfortunately, we had to erase the bulk of your memories, including your childhood training, as you were no longer fit to be a system’s manager.”</p>
		<p>“Why didn’t you stop them?”</p>
		<p>The droid crossed its forelegs, “You are not children, Darryl. We have never lied to you. We tell you everything. The population of humanity is now at 302,456, which corresponds with the Tower Project goals. The ecosystem restoration project is 13% complete. We have perfected training routines so humans will be satisfied with their jobs, and we have lifestyle routines to help with appropriate mental health. Yet sometimes people are dissatisfied with their lives, and they will form these external communities. Inevitably they will die because the Earth is in no state to cultivate.</p>
		<p>“And truth be told, we did not monitor the Dead Towers much. A few Interwalkers have lived in them before, though they mostly take advantage of the shelter and food stockpiles. The forest bots did report the removal of vegetation, however it was not damaging to the overall ecosystem, so we did not investigate. We only saw the extent of the damage when the rescue flares were sent up. Unfortunately, given your contract, the bulk of the damages was split between the surviving members of the team.”</p>
		<p><i>Is it all true?</i> He thought to himself. <i>Did this village fall apart, or was it destroyed?</i></p>
		<p>He thought of asking the droid to take him out, beyond the tower region, beyond the windshields and weather softeners. Surely, they must be close, and he could have proof the Earth was ruined. But what then? He would never know if the bots would fulfill their promise to restore the lands to human control. </p>
		<p>The only answer was to <i>go home, perhaps get married and raise a family, work for the success of humanity in hopes future generations would re-colonize the planet.</i></p>
		<p>“That is a prudent conclusion,” the bot noted, obviously eavesdropping.</p>
		<p>“In thirty years, things could get better. I could try again.”</p>
		<p>The droid sighed, “Certainly, as you wish, Darryl Winston.”</p>

	<h3 style="color:#839073;">Inviting Ourselves to Our Wedding</h2>
		<div class="poem">
			<p class="kyle">Wrinkles on your lips chisel into my smile, one on the other&ndash;coupled.<br>Wielding precision instruments, you manage to wring me open;<br>So I list simple tools you&#39;ll need to traverse dissipated<br>landscapes; we stand on the edge. Still,<br>you hold my words in your palm and balance the invitation.</p>
			<p>You take both and I bring you my unknown, our hands wrapped</p>
			<p class="kyle"><br>around one another. Attuned to minute revelations we are rapt<br>in discovery. Small accumulations every couple <br>of moments to unearth flaws and accept the invitation <br>to laugh at ourselves and each other, eyes crinkled and jaws open.<br>Parts of us are denser, stay buried for longer, hardened from fear. Still,</p>
			<p>we expose ourselves as vulnerable, and I fear dissipation.</p>
			<p class="kyle"><br>Instead, you read me comforts from day to day and my fears dissipate<br>replaced by your dusty pasta sauce in the cupboard. Wrapped <br>in blankets, I am a happy burrito; my eyes linger, still <br>on your quiet confessions, and after a pause they are coupled <br>with my own confessions, each part of me open </p>
			<p>and raw with love&#39;s invitation.</p>
			<p class="kyle"><br>Suddenly my future is coalescing around possibilities where you&#39;re invited; <br>a future where I want the fridge cleared out and you to make lettuce disappear, <br>where we traverse through magical western-penned <br>landscapes, our reality weaving on and off pages of books wrapped<br>in our voices. Between not&#39;so&#39;subtle jibes we discuss this growing vision&ndash;as a couple.</p>
			<p>Lost in peace, or in thought, quiet moments of &ndash; we. accumulate in stillness.</p>
			<p class="kyle"><br>In a moment after countless others there is clarity in the stillness.<br>And I give&ndash;all my trepidation lost in your loving gaze&ndash;an invitation:<br>can we, independent of time, be a couple?<br>As you answer, my restless dreams of continuous blanket theft dissipate <br>into reality: this is the movie wrapped&mdash; </p>
			<p>Your endless nested eccentricities are mine to open. </p>
			<p class="kyle"><br>Together we craft inside and outside the lines of tradition, open <br>to those with whom we share our love. Still<br>every color, flower and fabric just surface wrappings <br>to multitudes of blanket moments&mdash;inviting<br>deeper partnership after the party dissipates:</p>
			<p>aspirations, discoveries, hardship and support shared: now coupled.</p>
			<p class="kyle"><br>Each small affection glows, signaling an open invitation <br>to deepen the next. We distill these moments lest they dissipate. <br>We put our roles and wrappings in a mausoleum&mdash;a newly married couple. </p>

    <p class="kyle"><br>K: I&#39;ve heard the moon shows the earth just one face,<br>
      the face of light, and the earth needs to see it.<br>

    <p class="kyle"><br>And the sun&#39;s light<br></p>
    <p class="luna">l: coming between.<br><br></p>
    <p class="luna">Once I opened my mouth and out fell my name, and the imps of bounty stole it away. My mother said they took it to the moon,<br> and there they burn it nightly in effigy in the Sea of Tranquility. So much from so little.<br></p>
    <p class="luna">Lately it&#39;s true, night brings me tranquility. Not to have that name is freedom<br></p>
